        title: "Quantum Computing for AI Applications",
        abstract: "Quantum computing represents a promising alternative to cope with the need to analyze ever-increasing amounts of information. This talk introduces the domain of Quantum Artificial Intelligence, with a focus on how quantum computation can help to improve classical AI methods in solving challenging tasks with demanding computational requirements. In particular, we will discuss some typical AI problems in the context of machine learning, multi-agent systems, scheduling and planning, and we will examine several quantum approaches, with particular care to the advantages with respect to their classical counterparts.",

        when: "December 2022",
        where: "Saarland University, Saarbruecken, Germany",
        title: "Quantum Computing: A Classical Perspective",
        abstract: "Quantum computing represents a groundbreaking paradigm in computation, offering the potential to overcome the limitations inherent in classical approaches. This presentation puts forth a classical perspective on the field of quantum computing, delving into the opportunities and challenges posed by addressing classical hard computational problems through various quantum computational paradigms. These include fault-tolerant quantum algorithms, hybrid quantum-classical computation, and quantum annealing.",
