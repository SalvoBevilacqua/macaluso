        where: "German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI), Saarbruecken",
        when: "August 2021 - February 2022",
        info: "My research focuses on designing and implementing quantum algorithms for complex artificial intelligence problems. I am working on supervised learning to improve classical methods by means of quantum computation. Moreover, I am developing novel quantum solutions for selected AI problems with applications in the automotive industry. These include reinforcement learning for collision-free navigation of autonomous vehicles, coordination of multi-agent systems for cooperative services, and optimizing flexible production processes in Industry 4.0.",

        when: "November 2017 - December 2020",
        info: "The main focus of my Ph.D. was the designing and implementation of novel quantum machine learning algorithms. In particular, the contribution of my dissertation was twofold:(i) the proposal of a general framework for supervised learning whose special cases are a new quantum neural network architecture and the quantum counterpart of ensemble algorithms in machine learning; (ii) the proposal of a quantum algorithm for approximating non-linear activation function in quantum neural networks.",
